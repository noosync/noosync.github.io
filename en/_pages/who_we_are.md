NooSync is studio of experimented professionals in product development and software engineering, collaborating closely to clients.
 
We do hold strong expertise in:
SaaS (Software as a Service), ALM (Aplication lifecycle management) and SDLC (Software development lifecycle). Local or distributed Team setup, mentoring, coaching, recruitment. Lean and Agile project, product and software development.

Our mindset is to help our clients to grow their business to the next level. We want not only to understand the application and its code, but we mainly want to understand the business itself and how you can use our skills to reach the next level.

We take pride in our software development expertise. We handle infrastructure administration and ensure service reliability.

<h5>From good to great</h5>
We are always in the search for improvements, in technology and processes, by taking the best, changing, adapting to what fits best. We never stop at just "good enough", but always strive for “great” — and then some more.

<h5>Lean Mindset, Agile, Excelence</h5>
Improve to bring more value to our clients is one of our key work principles. 
Inception, Build-Measure-Learn approach, pair programming, TDD, and other processes and approaches are all aimed at building better products, building them efficiently and spending optimal amount of resources.  

Part of NooSync’s vision is building great products for both ourselves and our clients. We build them using lean and agile practices.

<h5>The creators of ChiliPepper app</h5>
We are the creators of the ChiliPepper app, a restaurant ordering and financial management SaaS product, currently in the stage of getting traction with MVP running on local customers in Rio de Janeiro.
