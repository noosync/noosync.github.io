We help you identify the obstacles preventing your teams from delivering consistent customer value and support teams to adapt and improve their Agile approach. Agile principles are easy to understand but challenging to adopt and master.  

Your organization embraced Agile the practices are in place,  there was an improvement but results not yet as expected. Practices are implemented but results are not consistent. Sprints not always finish, or issues on estimation, product backlog unrefined, it is a “development team practice”, weak definition of done, lack of vision, how to recognize the possibilities for improvement, etc.  

Some of the tasks we can perform:
- Assessment of agility maturity in terms of existing software/product development life cycle, procedures, practices, responsibilities, resources/competencies;  
- In-house formal education of relevant stakeholders and teams;
- Formulation of the vision, goals, strategies and tactics for Agile transformation;  
- Monitoring, mentoring and coaching the individuals and teams at all organizational levels;  
- Support teams  through all phases: forming, storming, norming and performing;  
- Continuous retrospective and review of the current projects;  
- Consultancy on the specific challenges within the agile initiative.
